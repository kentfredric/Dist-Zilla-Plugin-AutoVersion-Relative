# ABSTRACT: Time-Relative versioning

# $Id:$

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Like all things, time is relative.
This plugin is to allow you to auto-increment versions based on a relative time point.

It doesn't do it all for you, you can choose, its mostly like L<< The C<AutoVersion> Plugin|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::AutoVersion >>
except there's a few more user-visible entities, and a few more visible options.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

To configure this, you specify the date that the version is to be
relative to.

=head2 Serving Suggestion

  [AutoVersion::Relative]
  major = 1
  minor = 1
  year  = 2009 ;  when we did our last major rev
  month = 08   ;   "           "
  day   = 23   ;   "           "
  hour  = 05   ;   "           "
  minute = 30  ;   "           "
  second = 00  ;  If you're that picky.

  time_zone = Pacific/Auckland  ;  You really want to set this.

   ; 1.0110012
  format = {{$major}}.{{sprintf('%02d%04d%02d', $minor, days, hours }}

For the list of tuneables and how to use them, see

=head1 WARNING

If you don't specify Y/M/D, it will default to Jan 01, 2000 , because I
couldn't think of a more sane default. But you're setting that anyway, because
if you don't,you be cargo cultin' the bad way

=head1 FORMATTING

There are a handful of things we inject into the template for you

  # Just to give you an idea, you don't really want to be using this though.
  {{ $major }}.{{ $minor }}{{ days }}{{ hours }}{{ $relative->seconds }}

See L</FORMAT FIELDS> for the available fields and their use.


=field $major

The value set for major

=field $minor

The value set for minor

=field $relative

A L<< C<DateTime::Duration>|DateTime::Duration >> object

=field cldr

=field cldr($ARG)

CLDR for the current time. See L<DateTime/format_cldr>

=field days

See L</days_accurate>

Used to use the algorithm as used in L</days_square> but uses the algorithm  in L</days_accurate> since 0.03000000

=field days_square

An approximation of the number of days passed since milestone.

Note that for this approximation, it is assumed all months are 31 days long, and years as such,
have 372 days.

This is a legacy way of computing dates, superceded by days_accurate since 0.03000000

=field days_accurate

The number of days passed since the milestone.

=field hours

The remainder number of hours elapsed.
