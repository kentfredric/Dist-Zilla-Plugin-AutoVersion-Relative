NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::AutoVersion::Relative - Time-Relative versioning

VERSION
    version 1.000000

SYNOPSIS
    Like all things, time is relative. This plugin is to allow you to
    auto-increment versions based on a relative time point.

    It doesn't do it all for you, you can choose, its mostly like The
    "AutoVersion" Plugin except there's a few more user-visible entities,
    and a few more visible options.

CONFIGURATION
    To configure this, you specify the date that the version is to be
    relative to.

  Serving Suggestion
      [AutoVersion::Relative]
      major = 1
      minor = 1
      year  = 2009 ;  when we did our last major rev
      month = 08   ;   "           "
      day   = 23   ;   "           "
      hour  = 05   ;   "           "
      minute = 30  ;   "           "
      second = 00  ;  If you're that picky.

      time_zone = Pacific/Auckland  ;  You really want to set this.

       ; 1.0110012
      format = {{$major}}.{{sprintf('%02d%04d%02d', $minor, days, hours }}

    For the list of tuneables and how to use them, see "ATTRIBUTES" and
    "DATE ATTRIBUTES"

FORMATTING
    There are a handful of things we inject into the template for you

      # Just to give you an idea, you don't really want to be using this though.
      {{ $major }}.{{ $minor }}{{ days }}{{ hours }}{{ $relative->seconds }}

    See "FORMAT FIELDS" for the available fields and their use.

WARNING
    If you don't specify Y/M/D, it will default to Jan 01, 2000 , because I
    couldn't think of a more sane default. But you're setting that anyway,
    because if you don't,you be cargo cultin' the bad way

ATTRIBUTES
  major
  major = 1
  minor
  minor = 1
  format
  format = {{ sprintf('%d.%02d%04d%02d', $major, $minor, days, hours) }}
    See "FORMATING"

DATE ATTRIBUTES
  year
  year = 2000
  month
  month = 1
  day
  day = 1
  minute
  minute = 0
  second
  second = 0
  time_zone
    You want this.

    Formatting is like, "Pacific/Auckland" , or merely "+1200" format.

FORMAT FIELDS
  $major
    The value set for major

  $minor
    The value set for minor

  $relative
    A "DateTime::Duration" object

  cldr
  cldr($ARG)
    CLDR for the current time. See "format_cldr" in DateTime

  days
    See "days_accurate"

    Used to use the algorithm as used in "days_square" but uses the
    algorithm in "days_accurate" since 0.03000000

  days_square
    An approximation of the number of days passed since milestone.

    Note that for this approximation, it is assumed all months are 31 days
    long, and years as such, have 372 days.

    This is a legacy way of computing dates, superseded by days_accurate
    since 0.03000000

  days_accurate
    The number of days passed since the milestone.

  hours
    The remainder number of hours elapsed.

METHODS
  provide_version
    returns the formatted version string to satisfy the roles.

ATTRIBUTE METHODS
  has_time_zone <- predicate('time_zone')
